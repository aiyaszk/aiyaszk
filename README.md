# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! 
Iâ€™m a highschool student from Turkey who adores every aspect of computers! I'm especially interested in Game development along with parts of AI. 
I'm currently learning about the computer hardware and WPILIB library for FRC, studying Flutter and some front end languages.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any Game Jams. I can use Unity Engine and GameMaker Studio 2. I also am a amateur artist that can draw sprites via Aseprite or create 3D models on Zbrush. Moreover, if there is any narrative needed for games I use Procreate to draw digitally.
Feel free to reach me via alya.kurt@gmail.com!
