# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! 
Iâ€™m a highschool student who adores every aspect of computers! I'm especially interested in VR, AR, Game development along with parts of AI. 
I'm currently learning about the computer hardware and WPILIB library for my first FRC year, studying Flutter and exploring some front end languages.

I also am a huge animation and 3D design geek so I love working on Occulus Quest 2 games as well :) I started side loading and making my XR projects in Unity this summer. Hope to improve myself more on this topic! If you are also exploring this field I would love to have a chat with you.

Currently Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Game Jams too. I can use Unity Engine, Sandbox Game Maker and GameMaker Studio 2. I also am an amateur artist that can draw sprites via Aseprite or create 3D models on Zbrush. Moreover, if there is any narrative needed for games I use Procreate to draw digitally.
